MarriotHotelDatabase
The goal is to build an application that uses a database backend. Explore the
official website, identify essential information to store in the database. Create
the database and load mock data to support a wide range of SQL queries.
The application should support a basic interface, Create, Read, Update, and
Delete (CRUD) operations, and test several use cases identified for the
database application.

3 Database Requirements

3.1 Users
Clearly identify the type of users for the database application selected for this project and
describe the role of each user.

3.2 Data, relationships, and constraints
Identify the type of data, data relationships, data semantics, and any constraints to be
considered during the database creation. Clearly describe each of these design aspects
considered for your database application.

3.3 Use cases
Identify and clearly describe the database use cases the need to be tested using the
application. Develop sample queries that are suitable to test each use case.

4 Application Requirements
The application should support the following features:
▪ A user-friendly interface that allows users to connect to the
database.
▪ Basic CRUD operations (such as add/delete/modify records), and
complex sample queries (such as set operations, aggregate
functions, set membership, set comparison, subqueries using
WITH clause, etc.).
▪ Test a variety of use cases identified for the selected application.
• These may include search and browse products/services,
put products into a shopping cart, place an order, compute
relevant analytics, etc.
